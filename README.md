# GameFeed

Sports feed and social platform using the MERN stack.

## Description

GameFeed is a sports platform built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It provides real-time updates and information about various sports events and breaking sports news, and allows for interaction between users, including following, commenting on games, and more. The application utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface, user authorization using jsonwebtoken (JWT) and Context API for state management. Additionally, GameFeed employs Puppeteer for web scraping live scores, player stats, and other relevant real-time data directly from NBA.com, offering users up-to-date and comprehensive sports information, and newsapi.org for the latest news in the sports world.
